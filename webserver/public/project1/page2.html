    <h1>What is my favorite food?</h1>
    <h2>🍦 ICE CREAM!! 🍦</h2> 
    <h3>Who doen't like ICE CREAM? ❤️</h3>
    <p>Sadly I have a weak stomach 😕 so I can't have too much 😭</p>
    <p>Random fun fact: enjoying ice cream after a balanced meal with protein, fat, and fiber, your body can slow down the sugar rush and keep things chill.</p>
